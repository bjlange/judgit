{"name":"Judgit","tagline":"A machine learning approach to predicting popularity of a submission on Reddit, for EECS 349 at Northwestern University","body":"#Background\r\n\r\nContent aggregation is a large, expanding business on the internet. The biggest content aggregation community, Reddit, gets about 15 million unique visitors and 150 million pageviews per month. Users post content from other websites, attracting readers and commenters. These posts are voted on by Reddit users, resulting in a score that reflects the success of the post. Subreddits are subcommunities within Reddit and work the same way, except that the community has a specific focus. A successful Reddit post can generate tens of thousands of hits to a particular website, so naturally website owners are interested in how to make successful posts.\r\n\r\n#Project\r\n\r\nOur project is to use the k-nearest-neighbors algorithm to predict the score that a new post will receive 48 hours after being posted. Specifically, we are focusing on the following high-volume subreddits:\r\n \r\n * /r/AskReddit\r\n * /r/News \r\n * /r/Music \r\n * /r/Videos \r\n * /r/Politics \r\n * /r/Funny \r\n * /r/Cats\r\n\r\n#Current Progress\r\nSo far we have a server to develop on and a working scraper. The learner and the framework is still in progress. Check back in the next couple weeks for updates on our findings, and watch our project in progress at [Github](https://github.com/bjlange/judgit).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
